## Hi there 👋

I'm ptak a self taught beginner programmer based in Germany.

I recently found a new passion for coding and I wanna build everything I'm interested in.

If something comes through my mind I will start building it!

Currently I've only learnt Python and I use PyQt6 quite often. I'm also trying to get into pixel art for which I will use Aseprite!

Fun Facts:
`- I own 4 parrots
`- I love visual novel games!
`- I'm very passionate about music
`- Hobbies: playing guitar, gym, video games
